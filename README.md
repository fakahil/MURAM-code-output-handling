# MURAM-code-output-handling
This repo contains codes which can be used to test needed operations on the output data of the magnetohydrodynamic simulations done by the code MURAM.

# Output of MURAM:
The cubes have dimensions of (x,z,y)
eos_T: temperature
eos_P: pressure
result_0: density
result_1,2,3: velocity (Vx,Vz,Vy)
result_4: total energy 
result_5,6,7: the magnetic field (Bx,Bz,By)
