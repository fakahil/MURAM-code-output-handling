# MURAM-code-output-handling
This repo contains codes which can be used to test needed operations on the output data of the magnetohydrodynamic simulations done by the code MURAM.

# Output of MURAM:
The cubes have dimensions of (x,z,y)<br/>
eos_T: temperature <br/>
eos_P: pressure <br/>
result_0: density <br/>
result_1,2,3: velocity (Vx,Vz,Vy) <br/>
result_4: total energy  <br/>
result_5,6,7: the magnetic field (Bx,Bz,By) <br/>
